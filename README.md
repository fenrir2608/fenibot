# Feni

I made Feni just to have some fun on my community server. It’s a pretty simple bot with a bunch of commands for greetings, basic math, and even some fun GIFs. Nothing too serious—just something to make the server a bit more lively.

## What It Can Do

- **General Stuff:**
  - `feni hi`: Say hi and get a random greeting back.
  - `feni helps`: Brings up some interactive buttons with more commands and links.

- **Math Stuff:**
  - `feni add <numbers>`: Adds up some numbers.
  - `feni mul <numbers>`: Multiplies some numbers.
  - `feni subs <numbers>`: Subtracts numbers one after another.
  - `feni div <numbers>`: Divides numbers (and yes, it handles dividing by zero).

- **Fun Stuff:**
  - `feni gf`: Sends a random GIF (because why not?).
  - `feni bf`: Opens a surprise video link (you might not want to click it, just saying).
  - `feni gif <search_term>`: Tries to find a GIF on Tenor (still working on this one).

- **Links:**
  - `feni fenrir`: Takes you to my YouTube channel.
  - `feni feni`: Same as above—just another way to get there.

## How to Set It Up

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install the needed stuff:
   ```bash
   pip install discord.py
   ```
3. Pop your bot token into the `TOKEN` variable in the code.
4. Run it:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```
